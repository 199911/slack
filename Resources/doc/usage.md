## Usage

In this chapter I want to give you an overall idea of how to send payloads to the Slack API, accessing the methods
that it has made available.

To do this, I'm going to be using an example scenario where I want to send a message to Slack, which is probably the
scenario that drove you to this package in the first place (am I right :smile:?). So let's get slacking:


### Sending a payload to Slack (in this case: chat.postMessage)

Most likely you will just want to send some messages to one of your Slack channels, so here's how you do it:

First, we need to construct the client that will be communicating with the Slack API. To do this you will be using the
API token that you should have generated by now.

*NOTE: If you haven't created your own API token yet, check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) doc to do so now.*

```php
// construct the client object
$apiClient = new ApiClient('your-slack-token-here');

// ...

$payload = new ChatPostMessagePayload();
$payload->setChannel('general');
$payload->setMessage('Hello world!');
```

Every method that the Slack API provides has been converted into a special `payload`-class. This is because not every
method requires the same data, and some methods even send data back. For sending a message, this class is aptly called the
`ChatPostMessagePayload` class. Actually, all payloads follow their API-method's name, camel-cased to follow PSR standards,
in this case converted from `chat.postMessage`.

All that's left to do now is to send the payload we created. This is very simple as well:
```php

/** @var ChatPostMessagePayloadResponse $response
$response = $apiClient->send($payload);

// the following is very much up to you, this is just a very simple example
if ($response->isOk()) {
    echo sprintf('Successfully posted message on %d', $response->getTimestamp());
} else {
    echo sprintf('Failed to post message to Slack: %s', $response->getErrorExplanation());
}
```

That's it! If you provided a valid token and used the instructions above, there should now be a message `Hello World!`
posted in the `#general` of your team's Slack instance. If this did not happen, check out the instructions for handling
errors below.

*NOTE:* Although the setters and getters are different of each payload, they are all handled in a similar way as illustrated above.
