                    <h2>Usage</h2>
<p>In this chapter I want to give you an overall idea of how to send payloads to the Slack API, accessing the methods
that it has made available.</p>
<p>To do this, I'm going to be using an example scenario where I want to send a message to Slack, which is probably the
scenario that drove you to this package in the first place (am I right :smile:?). So let's get slacking!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For detailed examples of each and every method that this library supports, check out the <a href="methods/index.html">method reference</a>.</p>
<h3>1) Setting up the client</h3>
<p>First, we need to construct the client that will be communicating with the Slack API. To do this you will be using the
API token that you should have generated by now.</p>
<p>If you haven't created your own API token yet, check out the <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> doc to do so now.</p>
<p>Once obtained, you should provide it as the constructor argument. Alternatively, you can provide a token on each call you
make to the <code>send()</code>-method (see further below); it all depends on how you use this in your application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$client = new ApiClient('your-api-token-here');</code></pre>
<h3>2) Sending a payload (here: chat.postMessage)</h3>
<p>Most likely you will just want to send some messages to one of your Slack channels, so here's how you do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$payload = new ChatPostMessagePayload();
$payload-&gt;setChannel('general');
$payload-&gt;setMessage('Hello world!');</code></pre>
<p>See how every method that the Slack API provides has been converted into a special <code>payload</code>-class. This is because not every
method requires the same data, and some methods even send data back. For sending a message, this class is aptly called the
<code>ChatPostMessagePayload</code> class.</p>
<p>Actually, all payloads follow their API-method's name, camel-cased to follow PSR standards,
in this case converted from <code>chat.postMessage</code>.</p>
<p>All that's left to do now is to send the payload we created. This is very simple as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">/** @var ChatPostMessagePayloadResponse $response */
$response = $client-&gt;send($payload);

// the following is very much up to you, this is just a very simple example
if ($response-&gt;isOk()) {
    echo sprintf('Successfully posted message on %d', $response-&gt;getTimestamp());
} else {
    echo sprintf('Failed to post message to Slack: %s', $response-&gt;getErrorExplanation());
}</code></pre>
<p>That's it! If you provided a valid token and used the instructions above, there should now be a message <code>Hello World!</code>
posted in the <code>#general</code> of your team's Slack instance. If this did not happen, check out the instructions for handling
errors below.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Although the setters and getters are different of each payload, they are all handled in a similar way as illustrated above.</p>
