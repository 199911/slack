{"name":"Slack API","tagline":"Slack API library for PHP","body":"# Slack API library [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n\r\nAccess your Slack Team's API through PHP objects.\r\n\r\n*If your project is built on top of the Symfony Framework, consider using the bundle I created for it: [SlackBundle](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle).\r\n*If you would like to access the Slack API from the command-line, consider installing the [slack-cli](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack-cli) package.*\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cleentfaar/slack.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/?branch=master)\r\n[![Code Coverage](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/badges/coverage.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/?branch=master)<br/>\r\n[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/v/stable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/downloads.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n[![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/v/unstable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Getting started](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack/tree/master/src/CL/Slack/Resources/doc/getting-started.md) - Before you use this library, you need to generate a token or setup oAuth.\r\n- [Installation](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack/tree/master/src/CL/Slack/Resources/doc/installation.md) - Information on installing this library through composer or as a git submodule.\r\n- [Usage](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack/tree/master/src/CL/Slack/Resources/doc/usage.md) - A few simple examples on how to access the Slack API using this library\r\n- [API methods](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack/tree/master/src/CL/Slack/Resources/doc/methods/index.md) - Detailed information on each of Slack's API methods and how to access them using this library's `Payload` classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Access all of Slack's API methods with dedicated payload classes (see [usage documentation](https://github.com/cleentfaar/slack/tree/master/src/CL/Slack/Resources/doc/usage.md))\r\n- Payloads and responses follow the same definitions as described in the [official documentation](https://api.slack.com) (with a few exceptions where I think it would make a better distinction).\r\n- Data between you and Slack is serialized using the [JMS Serializer](https://github.com/jms/serializer) package,\r\nallowing for complex objects to be sent while maintaining an OO-approach.\r\n- Code has been highly abstracted to support re-use in more specific implementations (see [SlackBundle](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further reading\r\n\r\nI've done my best to include links to the official documentation in the code where appropriate.\r\n\r\nStill, you should really check out the [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/) of Slack yourself to get a better\r\nunderstanding of exactly what each API method does and what data it will return.\r\n\r\nIf you feel there is some part of this package that you would like to see documented in more detail, please don't hesitate\r\nto create an issue for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nGot a good idea for this project?
