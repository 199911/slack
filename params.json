{"name":"Slack","tagline":"A PHP library providing integration with the Slack API","body":"# Slack [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n\r\nFull-featured Slack API client for PHP.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If your project is built on top of the Symfony Framework, consider using the bundle I created for it [here](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle).\r\nAdditionally, the bundle provides [console commands](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/commands.md) for all the Slack API methods\r\nthat are implemented by this library.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cleentfaar/slack.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/?branch=master)\r\n[![Code Coverage](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/badges/coverage.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/cleentfaar/slack/?branch=master)<br/>\r\n[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/v/stable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/downloads.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n[![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/slack/v/unstable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/slack)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Getting a token](Resources/doc/getting-started.md) - Before you use this library, you need to generate a token or setup oAuth.\r\n- [Installation](Resources/doc/installation.md) - Information on installing this library through composer or as a git submodule.\r\n- [Usage](Resources/doc/installation.md) - A few simple examples on how to access the Slack API using this library\r\n- [API methods](Resources/doc/methods/index.md) - Detailed information on each of Slack's API methods and how to access them using this library's `Payload` classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Allows you to access all the Slack API methods through easy-to-use payload classes (see [usage documentation](Resources/doc/usage.md))\r\n- `Payload` and `PayloadResponse` follow the same definition as described in the official documentation (*)\r\n- `Payload` and `PayloadResponse` classes are serialized using the [JMS Serializer](https://github.com/jms/serializer) package,\r\nallowing for complex data to be passed while maintaining an OO-approach.\r\n- Code has been highly abstracted to support re-use in more specific implementations (see [SlackBundle](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLSlackBundle))\r\n\r\n    \\* = small exceptions excluded; for example, the `channel` parameter is accessed using `getChannelId()`, not `getChannel()`\r\n\r\n### Further reading\r\n\r\nI've done my best to include links to the official documentation in the code where I thought it would clarify things.\r\nStill, you should really check out the [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/) of Slack yourself to get a better\r\nunderstanding of exactly what each API method does and what data it will return.\r\n\r\nIf you feel there is some part of this package that you would like to see documented in more detail, please don't hesitate\r\nto create an issue for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n| Question                                      | Answer                                                                                                          |\r\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Why isn't this package marked 'stable' yet?   | The Slack API has not reached a stable state yet, and so I cannot claim to have a stable package for it either. |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nGot a good idea for this project? Found a nasty bug that needs fixing? That's great!\r\nBefore submitting your PR though, make sure it complies with the [contributing guide](Resources/doc/contributing.md) to\r\nspeed up the merging of your code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Attributions\r\n\r\n- The [Slack](https://slack.com/) staff, for making an awesome product and very clean API documentation.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
